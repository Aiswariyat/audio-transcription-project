# audio-transcription-project
This repository contains an audio transcription project using the `Wave2Vec2` model and the PolyAI/minds14 dataset. The goal of the project is to transcribe conversational audio files into text, suitable for meeting notes and similar use cases.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of the pretrained `facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h` model for speech-to-text transcription. The transcriptions are consolidated into a single text file (`all_transcriptions.txt`) for ease of review.

### Dataset
- **PolyAI/minds14**: A lightweight dataset of conversational audio files, ideal for transcription tasks.

### Model
- **Wave2Vec2**: A pretrained model optimized for general-purpose English speech transcription.
